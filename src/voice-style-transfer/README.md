# ðŸŽ­ Voice Style Transfer 

## Project Overview

The Voice Style Transfer application will leverage the Sesame CSM-1b model to transform a user's voice into different speaking styles while preserving their unique voice characteristics. This tool will allow users to adapt their voice for various contextsâ€”from professional presentations to casual conversations to storytellingâ€”without losing their personal voice identity.
